## Introduction
### Why this analysis?
We have all played Video games at some point of time in our life. Be it on a console like Xbox or PlayStation, or PC or a mobile phone. Many scientists have concluded that playing video games have several benefits. It can be a stress and pain reliever. For some, video games are place to socialize with other fellow gamers. 
Video games have been proven to develop problem solving skills. They help us recognize patterns better and improve our eye-coordination as well. 

We are in 2023 and it is expected that the video game industry is going to exceed $350 bn with an annual growth rate of more than 7%.  As the video game industry is growing slowly, we wanted answers for several questions that we have had about the industry. 

In this project, we have divided this analysis into 3 sections:

1. Analyzing video game sales on different platforms
2. Analyzing different metrics of video games on a streaming site (Twitch)
3. Analyzing E-Sports earnings

### About the datasets:
In this project, we will be using 3 different datasets to perform a comprehensive analysis of different aspects of the gaming industry. 

1. Video Game Sales Data(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/holmjason2/videogamedata): This dataset includes data on video games that were published between 1980 and 2020. The dataset has 16 columns and 55,519 entries including data on the game's name, platform, publisher, genre, sales statistics broken down by area, and user reviews.
   This dataset can be used to investigate the relationship between user ratings and sales figures, identify popular genres and platforms, and analyze trends in the video game industry.

2. Top Games on Twitch 2016 - 2021(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rankirsh/evolution-of-top-games-on-twitch): In this link, there are two datasets (csv files). First one has data about top 200 games based on number of hours watched on Twitch from 2016-2023 and second one has overall information about Twitch over the years like total watch hours month wise and year wise.
   The title of the dataset is misleading as it says from 2016-2021, but in the dataset, it also has data for 2022 and January 2023. 

3. Esports Earnings 1998 - 2023(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rankirsh/esports-earnings): The eSports Earnings dataset available on Kaggle provides information about the earnings of professional players and teams in the field of eSports. The data has been collected from various sources, including tournament organizers, team managers, and individual players.
   The data covers earnings from 1998 to 2023, and it is regularly updated with new information. This dataset can be useful for data analysts, researchers, and gamers who are interested in the eSports industry, its growth, and the distribution of earnings among players and teams.
